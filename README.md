Just a PHP project with a catalog of videos and login functionality.

## Learned and applied concepts and practices in this project

- PSRs;
- SOLID's **D** => Dependency Inversion;
- Dependency injection with container (using PHP-DI);
- PDO and PDOStatements;
- Traits;
- Securing and hashing passwords;

In this project, made from the *PHP for Web* training course of Alura, we built an application that has a login implementation and registers a list of embedded videos, set a title and offers the possibility to set a thumbnail for videos.
